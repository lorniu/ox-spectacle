* What's this?

*Make PRESENTATION with HTML5*.

- ReactJS based *Spectacle* by [[https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle][FormidableLabs]] is interesting.
- So I write this backend for Emacs's *Org-Mode*, which is my daily tool.
- It can help to simplify the presentation creation flow.

You can [[https://lorniu.github.io/spectacle-demo.html][click here to view the demo]].

* Configuration

Add something like this to your emacs config:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/ox-spectacle")
  (require 'ox-spectacle)
#+END_SRC

After that, you can write your own org-file, then export to a html with key:
: Ctrl-C Ctrl-E s f

The genereted html is the PRESENTATION file,
just open and show it in your browser.

* Syntax

You can read raw content of [[file:./spectacle-demo.org]] to learn the syntax.

Or [[https://lorniu.github.io/spectacle-demo.html][click here to view the demo show]] of the demo file, when view PRESENTATION
in your browser, ~alt p~ can lead you to see the syntax of current page.

It's simple.
